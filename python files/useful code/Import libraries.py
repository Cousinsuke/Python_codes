#Import libraries
#------------------

#python has a load of built in or downloadable modules called libraries
#these libraries are collections of modules - functions and proceses -
#which can be imported into your programs to access their functionality
#without you needing to 'reinvent the wheel' or clutter your program

#some common built in libraries are math, time, random

#some common downloadable libraries are:
#numpy ( vector maths), pygame ( 8 bit gaming),
#Panda ( 3d graphics) Beutiful soup ( data scraping)

import random  #part of the math module
import time   #imports time module from the CPU



   #to this. do this. (like this)
num = random.randint(1,100)#chooses a random integer within range
print(num)
time.sleep(1)#pause 1 second
